# CustomInstaGram

**CustomInstaGram** is a decentralized, ad-free social media idea built on Farcaster (Ethereum Layer 2). The goal: give users full control over their feed — who they see, what content they get, and how it’s ordered. No algorithms designed to addict. No ads. Just intentional connection.

## 🔍 What It Solves
- Social media addiction created by engagement-maximizing algorithms
- Lack of user control over feeds
- Ad-driven models that exploit attention

## 🛠️ Core Features
- Pull social graph data from Farcaster
- Customize who appears in your feed
- Filter by content type: text, images, video
- Choose feed order: chronological, recommended, or custom
- Modular architecture (mini-apps / frames)

## 📦 Tech Stack
- Farcaster (Ethereum Optimism Layer 2)
- React + Frames frontend
- Optional backend (Node or serverless)
- Off-chain storage (IPFS or DB)
